    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Katsu curry (Japanese: カツカレー, romanized: katsukarē) is a Japanese dish consisting of a pork cutlet (tonkatsu) served with a portion of Japanese rice and curry. 
        It is served on a large plate and is typically eaten using a spoon or fork. 
        The cutlet is usually precut into strips, eliminating the need for a knife.

    <h3>Ingrdients</h3>
    <ul>]
        <li>2 large chicken breasts</li>
        <li>400ml milk</li>
        <li>100g plain flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut each chicken breast in half lengthways, creating four fillets. 
            Put each fillet between two sheets of baking parchment and beat with a rolling pin to even out the thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the milk into a bowl and season with a large pinch of salt, then add the chicken fillets. 
            Cover and leave in the fridge for at least 20 mins or for up to 24 hrs (the longer you leave the chicken in the milk, the more succulent it will be).
        </li>
        <li>
            When you’re ready to coat the chicken, tip the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs into three separate bowls, then season the flour with the togarashi and stir the soy sauce into the eggs. 
            Scoop one chicken fillet out of the milk and coat in the flour mix, then dip into the egg mix and coat in the breadcrumbs. 
            Set on a plate and repeat with the rest of the chicken fillets. Can be prepared up to a day ahead and frozen for up to a month.
